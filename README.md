# Landing Page Project

This is a DOM manipulation project.

First, I've added a nav bar. The nav bar has the following functionalities:
1- The nav bar appears once scrolling to sections with a different color. That was done using Intersection Observer.
2- The nav list items have a hover effect.
3- Once reaching a specific section, the nav bar item of the section becomes highlighted. That was done getBoundingClientRect() function.
4- Once clicking on an item in the nav bar, the page will be scrolled to the section. A smoot scroll function was done using getBoundingClientRect() and implemented.

Lastly, a to the top button was added.

Git was also used to make commits in the project.
