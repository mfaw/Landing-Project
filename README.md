# Landing Page Project

This is a DOM manipulation project for Udacity's Web Development Professional Track.

Any code editor can be used to write this code. I used Visual Studio code and added git to commit the project's steps as much as possible.

This webpage can function on any web browser(usually chrome) through phones or laptops.

This project includes a nav bar that has been added dynamcially and features that would scroll to section on click and highlight the section.

The code was mostly by JavaScript and CSS was used for styling. HTML was used as well.
